## Notes
**Week 1:** 
Completing the required functions outlined in the videos CodePath provided was pretty simple, except for implementing the 3rd party loading state via CocoaPods. Even though I looked through all the documentation and wrote the necessary code, the loading state was not showing up when I ran my app. I also found implementing the search bar a bit difficult since I had to translate CodePath's guide, which used searching Strings as an example, to NSDictionaries.

# Project 2 - *Flicks*

- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Allow the infoView from the DetailsViewController scroll up towards the movie poster and not have the user scroll down to view the movie's information.
2. How to organize the data more clearly when the user views the tableView (ex. show full title of the movie instead of it cutting off).
